# Image-Stitching (Coursework)
A collection of visual computing techniques covering the following algorithms:

* 2D convolution: Sobel, Gaussian and Haar-like masks,
* SIFT features and descriptors,
* Homography transformation,
* Manual stitching,
* RANSAC,
* Panoramic image using ordered and unordered images.

All codes are implemented and tested using Matlab R2020b.
